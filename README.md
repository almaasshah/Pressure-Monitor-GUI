# Pressure-Monitor-GUI
This project is a simple GUI which monitors pressure changes from a Dwyer 616KD-11-V Transducer via a raspberry Pi and an ADC Converter. I also added in a relay Switch Control to switch a Relay On &amp; Off.  The GUI was Designed using PyQt5 and Qt Designer.  
For Those of you looking at the wiring, It states 5V Power Supply to the Transducer which is Wrong. You will need a 16-35V Power Supply to get the full output. 
Electrical-Pressure Conversion calculations may vary based on what transducer and input voltage you are supplying. In this programme I was using a 35V input supply.
